Alex is a DECRA Fellow at the University of Wollongong, Australia. He is fascinated by the challenge of building a cell from the bottom-up, using synthetic materials. His research to date has been focused on compartmentalisation, using materials such as block copolymers, complex coacervates, and water-in-oil droplet networks. 

He leads the Synthetic Biomimetic Compartments Lab at the University of Wollongong, which is aiming to create a synthetic chemical synapse using in vitro expressed membrane proteins, DNA nanotechnology, single molecule fluorescence microscopy, and a DIY nanoliter volume liquid handling robot named "DIB-BOT". If any of the above interests you, please send Alex a message!
